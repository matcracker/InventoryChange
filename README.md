# InventoryChange **[OUTDATED]**
Use InventoryExchanger (https://github.com/matcracker/InventoryExchanger) instead this.

InventoryChange is a plugin that allows you to change inventory when you change the world.

Its use is very simple.

+++FEATURES+++

- Save Inventory when you change world

- Being able to have the same inventory in two different worlds if you want (change InventoryChange.yml) (TODO) [Next Versions]

+++++++++++++++

If you find bugs write it in the thread and I will try to solve.

Thanks for downloading it!
